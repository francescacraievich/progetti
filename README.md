# Repository Overview

Welcome to my repository! Here you will find a collection of projects and labs developed throughout my academic journey.

## 📁 Repository Contents

### 1. SnakeGameSDM24  
An implementation of the classic Snake game developed in **Java** using **Java Swing** for the graphical interface. The project was created in a team following the **Scrum** methodology and applying the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** paradigm.

### 2. Advanced Internet Technologies  
This folder contains an in-depth analysis of networking technologies and protocols:
- **Google Meet Analysis**: network traffic analysis using **Wireshark**, **NetworkTab**, and **WebRTC internals**  
- **IPv6 Lab**  
- **VPN Lab**  
- **HTTP and QUIC Lab**

### 3. Thesis  
A cybersecurity summary titled _Phishing in the Free Waters: A Study of Phishing Attacks Created by Using Free Website Builder Services_, in which I analyze phishing techniques carried out through free website creation platforms.

### 4. Project  
Project developed for the **Advanced and Parallel Programming** course:
- **C**: implementation of a program to generate **Mandelbrot fractals** in **NETPBM** grayscale format  
- **Python**: extension of the code from the **11th lab session (December 19, 2023)** to support advanced mathematical operations, including relational operators like `>`, `>=`, `=`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, and other features explained in the code

### 5. Operating Systems  
This directory includes **5 labs** on advanced topics in operating systems:
- **Bash scripting**  
- **File management in C**  
- **Parallel processes**  
- **Synchronization for car rental management**  
- **Containers using Bash**

### 6. Database  
A project for the **Database** course, where I managed world data using **MySQL**. It includes the **Entity-Relationship diagram** and the **data dictionary**.

### 7. Cybersecurity  
This folder includes two penetration testing demos developed during hands-on labs using **Kali Linux** and **Metasploitable3**:

- **Demo 1**: Network scanning, SMB exploitation using EternalBlue, and system access via Meterpreter  
- **Demo 2**: Brute-force attacks on SSH and MySQL using **Hydra**, WordPress hash extraction, and password cracking with **John the Ripper**
- 
- # 🛡️ Cybersecurity Incident Response Challenge
This repository contains my work for a simulated ransomware attack scenario targeting a hospital's network infrastructure.
- **Task 1 - Malware Analysis**: Identified the initial infected host, exploited vulnerability, and possible attacker/C2 IP from network logs.
- **Task 2 - Containment**: Developed a Python script to detect compromised hosts and isolate them from the network.
- **Task 3 - Reverse Engineering**: Reconstructed the AES key from fragments and decrypted a critical file using CBC mode.
- **Task 4 - Incident Report**: Wrote a summary report outlining impact assessment and recovery strategy.
- **Task 5 (Optional) - Monitoring**: Built a basic monitoring tool to detect suspicious behavior in future network traffic.
